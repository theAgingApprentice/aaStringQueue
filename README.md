# aaStringQueue

This repository contains an Arduino library that provides your project with a [FIFO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFO_(computing_and_electronics)) queue for character arrays (char[]).

## Getting Started

This section will provide you with guidance to help determine if this library is approppriate for your needs as well as how to add it to your project.    

### Prerequisites
This library was written using Microsoft's [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs) source code editor in conjunction with the [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org/) [embedded software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embedded_software) [IDE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment). If you use the defaut Arduino IDE then you probebly should not use this library. 

The code in this library requires that your project includes the [Arduino Core library for ESP32](https://github.com/espressif/arduino-esp32) which is comes as part of the Arduino framework when building a project using Platform.io.

The installation instructions assume that you have Git installed on your computer.

### Code Compatibility

This library has only been tested on the [Adafruit Huzzah32](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-huzzah32-esp32-feather) development board containing the [Espressif ESP WROOM32 SOC](https://www.espressif.com/sites/default/files/documentation/esp32_datasheet_en.pdf) featuring a pair of [Cadence/XtensaÂ®32-bit LX6 microprocessors](https://mirrobo.ru/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Cadence_Tensillica_Xtensa_LX6_ds.pdf). 

### Installing

1. Navigate to the Arduino project directory on yur computer
2. Issue the command git clone 

## Running the tests

At this time there are no automated tests for this application.
